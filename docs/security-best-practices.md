# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for the BookTrackr app.

## API Key Security

### ✅ **DO:**
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Add `.env` files to `.gitignore`
- Use `--dart-define` for production builds
- Provide fallback data when API keys are not configured
- Log warnings in debug mode when API keys are missing

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Hardcode API keys in source code
- Commit API keys to version control
- Use the same API key for development and production
- Expose API keys in client-side code without proper restrictions

## Environment Variables

### Development
```bash
# Create .env file (not tracked by git)
GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=your_development_key_here
```

### Production
```bash
# Use --dart-define when building
flutter build apk --dart-define=GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=your_production_key_here
```

## Code Security

### Input Validation
- Always validate user input
- Use proper regex patterns for email/password validation
- Sanitize data before processing

### Error Handling
- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Implement proper timeout handling
- Validate API responses

## Firebase Security

### Authentication
- Use Firebase Auth for user authentication
- Implement proper sign-in/sign-out flows
- Validate user sessions

### Firestore Rules
- Set up proper Firestore security rules
- Restrict access based on user authentication
- Validate data before writing to Firestore

## Code Quality

### Static Analysis
- Use `flutter analyze` to catch potential issues
- Run SonarQube analysis regularly
- Fix security vulnerabilities promptly

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use only trusted packages
- Review package permissions

## Testing

### Security Testing
- Test with invalid API keys
- Test with malformed input
- Test error handling scenarios

### Penetration Testing
- Test authentication flows
- Test data validation
- Test API endpoint security

## Monitoring

### Logging
- Log security events
- Monitor API usage
- Track authentication attempts

### Alerts
- Set up alerts for unusual activity
- Monitor API quota usage
- Alert on authentication failures

## Incident Response

### Plan
- Have a plan for security incidents
- Document response procedures
- Test incident response regularly

### Communication
- Notify users of security issues
- Provide clear guidance on next steps
- Maintain transparency about security measures
